		<section><h1>Part 1</h1>
			<p> Sometimes I believe that doing these are very easy. I can use &lt;br&gt; to space out my paragraphs
			like the way I will space out the next one.<br><br>I also am using &lt;section&gt; to sort out how I 
			would seperate my paragraphs.</p>

		<section><h1> Part 2</h1>
			<p> This is the example of my sectioning. I also would be using the      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non Breaking Space &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; space 
			out&nbsp;&nbsp; these&nbsp;&nbsp; words&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp; example. I also need to use &lt;span&gt; to color these
			next few words.<span style="font-style:italic;color:red;font-weight:bold"> Here I am using Italic, bold, and color changed 
			letters.</span> I also found out how to use the copyright symbol &copy;.</p>
